## Running JavaScript
Three ways to add JS to HTML files:
1. Inline `<script>` tags in `<head>` (worst for performance, render-blocking),
2. Inline `<script>` tags in `<body>`, and
3. Linking to external `.js` files (recommended, boosts performance through browser caching).

Inline scripts in `<body>` are required for JS code that needs to immediately modify an HTML element?
